# Remote-IoT-data-monitoring-and-control
<h2>Project description</h2>
<p></p>In this project, the Arduino board is connected to Wi-Fi module and both act as a server. The Arduino Board is connected to 2 LEDs, 3 sensors (temperature, smoke, motion). The client which is a web browser - running on any computer connected to the same network as the Arduino- communicates to the server and controls it.</p>

The project must do the following 2 processes:<br>
<q>I. The Arduino board must monitor and display sensors data periodically (Temp, Motion, smoke) on LCD every 2 seconds.</q><br>
<q>II. The webpage will send a command to the Wi-Fi module to control the Arduino board and switch each of the LEDs on/off.</q>
